## Problem Statement
In this project we were tasked by the client to implement Artificial Intelligence based
methods to detect Atrial Fibrillation
***
## Project Background
Arrhythmia is a condition in which the heart beats with an abnormal/ irregular rhythm, too
fast or too slow. Over the years many such arrhythmias have been identified; amongst them
Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the most prevalent changes in heart rhythm. AF on its own
is not lethal most the time but it increases the risk of heart failure, stroke, pre mature death
and other cardiovascular diseases. Due to its prevalence in young and old patients alike AF has
been a topic of research interest in the last decade, researchers have used manual and automated
electrocardiography (ECG) signal monitoring to detect AF in patients. AF is hard to find in regular
health check-ups hence long-term ECG monitoring is required to detect AF. Manual monitoring
of ECG signals is not time and cost efficient hence, several machine learning and deep learning
methods have been developed to automate the detection.

## Data Description
We have used MIT-BIH Arrythmia databse for the implementation of this project, it is a public dataset provided by physionet
and it has ECG recordings of 48 patietns along with their correspodning annotations.
Link to the dataset and description : https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/

## Expected Outcome:
* We are tasked to find a way to use MIT BIH A fib database/ Physio net A fib database as data
sets are huge (10+GB each)

* We need to suggest appropriate ECG signal pre-processing methods.

* We are expected to use machine learning concepts to automate the process of AF detection.

* We are required to deliver a detailed project report. The report should consist of a review of
implemented algorithms and elaborate explanation about the best algorithm
